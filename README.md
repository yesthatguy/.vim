# .vim
Config dir for vim

Tracks my personal vim settings, plugins I've installed, etc.

To set up everything, clone this into ~/.vim on your computer.
If you need to recompile command-t binaries, see [here](https://github.com/wincent/command-t/blob/master/doc/command-t.txt)

Any questions or suggestions, let me know!
